# Daedalus
An STM32F405RGT6 based flight computer! It has integrated battery management, meaning you can connect up a 3.7V Li-Po directly to the board without worries!
It's also got an altimeter, 6-axis IMU, and a microSD card slot so you can track all your flight data and review post-launch.
The 5V boost line means you can power your components from the board! There are 4 MOSFET-controlled outputs to support this, including one ignition switch.
